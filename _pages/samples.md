There is always more easy to learn principles of a new paradigm through a set of well documented samples.

Thus we provide such samples in our [Github repository](https://github.com/uzyovoys/zenbot) so that you can test each of them to learn Zenbot more easy.

### How to use
Just fork this repository, create your test bot through [Zenbot web console](https://zenbot.org) and upload sample\'s Botscript.
Then you can test the newly created bot through web console, [REST API](/rest/) or even messengers like [Facebook Messenger](/messengers/facebook/), [Slack](/messengers/slack/) or [Telegram](/messengers/telegram/).

### Samples
***

#### [Hello World](https://github.com/uzyovoys/zenbot/tree/master/samples/helloworld)
A very simple bot which greets user by name or asks her about her name and stores it in the database for further usage.
