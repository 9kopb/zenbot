    <h3 id="1">What Zenbot is</h3>
    Zenbot is an online natural language processing service and chat bot hosting.

    <h3 id="2">What Zenbot can do</h3>
    Zenbot enables you to create Natural Language driven user interface for your application, website or messenger chat bot.
    So that you can create Siri-like complex dialog interface for any type of application or website and accept user's text or even voice input.

    <h3 id="3">How does it work</h3>
    Zenbot matches each text request through a set of currently active patterns in your Botscript.
    Matched pattern may activate a set of actions in the context which can perform some stuff.
    Then Zenbot returns one of the text output corresponding this context, so the user is walking through natural language dialog.

    You do not have to have any skills in programming or artificial intelligence discipline.

    <h3 id="7">How to create Botscript</h3>

    <h3 id="11">What are the differences between Zenbot and Wit.ai</h3>
    <p>There are a three major differences between Zenbot and Wit.ai:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Zenbot implements a full stack of NLP techniques, not only user's intent resolution.</p>
            <p>This means that you do not have to implement a user-to-machine conversation logic on your side.
            Zenbot proceeds each request, manages contexts, performs actions, evaluates scripts, collects and stores variables and generates text output.
            Thus the client system just sends a text request and receives a complete response.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Zenbot is based on the pattern matching mechanism instead of deep learning "magic".</p>
            <p>Pattern matching provides a NLP flexibility together with a full control of the dialog system.
            Thus Zenbot takes already human prepared data and works as expected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Zenbot doesn't provide any web interface for dialog structure designing.</p>
            <p>Such web interfaces often bring more confusion than a profit if you have a deal with complex dialogs.
            Thus Zenbot defines a simple XML file format where you can describe such dialog and manage it as a source code for your bot.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
