    <h3 id="1">What Is Zenbot?</h3>
    Zenbot is an online natural language processing service and chat bot hosting.

    <h3 id="2">What Can Zenbot Do?</h3>
    Zenbot allows you to create Natural Language driven user interface for your application, website or messenger chat bot.
    So that you can create Siri-like complex dialog interface for any type of application or website and accept user's text or even voice input.

    <h3 id="3">How Does It Work?</h3>
    Zenbot matches each text request through a set of currently active patterns in your Botscript.
    A matched pattern can activate a set of actions in the context which will perform some stuff.
    Then Zenbot returns one of the text output messages corresponding to this context, so the user is walking through a natural language dialog.

    <h3 id="4">How Much Does It Cost?</h3>
    Zenbot is free even for commercial use. No rate limits as well.

    <h3 id="5">How Do I Get Started?</h3>
    To make a new bot you have to create a Botscript which contains all data including the dialog with the user and actions Zenbot must perform.

    <h3 id="6">What Do I Need to Know before Starting?</h3>
    All you need to get started is to <a href="/botscript/">read about Botscript</a> and <a href="/samples/">look at some of our samples</a>.
    You do not have to have any skills in programming or artificial intelligence disciplines.

    <h3 id="7">How to Create a Botscript?</h3>
    A Botscript is a simple XML formatted file. You can create it with any text editor you like, for exaple, Sublime Text or Windows Notepad.

    <h3 id="8">How to Upload the Botscript to Zenbot?</h3>
    Just go to the <a href="https://zenbot.org">web console</a> and create a new bot. Then you will be prompted to upload your Botscript file.

    <h3 id="9">How to Use Zenbot from My Application or Website?</h3>
    Zenbot provides a <a href="/rest/">REST API</a> to allow you to make simple HTTP calls to integrate your application or website with your bot.

    <h3 id="10">How to Integrate Zenbot with My Facebook, Slack or Telegram Bot?</h3>
    Zenbot is already integrated with such messenger platforms as Facebook, Slack and Telegram.
    So, all you need to bind your Zenbot bot to these messengers is to provide your credentials in the <a href="https://zenbot.org">web console</a>.

    <h3 id="11">Which Languages Are Supported?</h3>
    Strictly speaking, Zenbot supports <strong>any language</strong> thanks to the flexible patterns syntax.
    So you can add user’s phrases in any language you wish.<br><br>
    <p>But some of general concepts (like Numbers, Date and Time handling) are built in Zenbot and support only a particular set of languages, such as English and Russian.</p>
    <p>All of them are open source and you can contribute to and extend these items with your language as well.</p>

    <h3 id="12">What Are the Differences between Zenbot and Wit.ai?</h3>
    <p>There are three major differences between Zenbot and Wit.ai:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Zenbot implements a full stack of NLP techniques, not only user’s intent resolution.</p>
            <p>This means that you do not have to implement a user-to-machine conversation logic on your side.
            Zenbot proceeds each request, manages contexts, performs actions, evaluates scripts, collects and stores variables and generates text output.
            Thus the client system just sends a text request and receives a complete response.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Zenbot is based on the pattern matching mechanism instead of deep learning "magic".</p>
            <p>Pattern matching provides an NLP flexibility together with full control of the dialog system.
            Thus Zenbot takes data already prepared by a human and works as expected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Zenbot doesn’t provide any web interface for dialog structure designing.</p>
            <p>Such web interfaces are often more confusing than useful if you deal with complex dialogs.
            Thus Zenbot defines a simple XML file format where you can describe such a dialog and manage it as the source code for your bot.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
