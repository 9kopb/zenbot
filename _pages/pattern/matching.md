## What pattern is
Think about patterns like a special flexible form of user\'s possible input.

{% include note.html text="You can also see some similarity to regular expressions if you have some experience with it.
But patterns are much more flexible and adopted specially to the natural human\'s language." %}

Without such mechanism like patterns we have to define a long list of possible user\'s inputs, so bot could find similarity between user\'s text input and one of defined input which bot understands.

Imagine such list for all variations of time or date: "Today", "Tomorrow", "This friday", "Last monday", "October 22nd"... Well, it is far from what we would like.
