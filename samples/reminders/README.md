### Reminder
This bot implements a flow of a new reminder creation.

This Botscript contains an [empty context](https://docs.zenbot.org/botscript/conversations/) "reminder" which does the final step of a dialog.
It also shows how you can use the idea of context referencing by ID.

### How to use
Send requests like "Remind me to call mom tomorrow" or "Buy flowers in 3 hours".
This bot supports conversation, so you can provide only a part of the phrase and bot will ask you about text of reminder, date and time.
